My name is Tatiana Vovk. In 2025 I have obtained my PhD in computational theoretical physics from IQOQI Innsbruck / University of Innsbruck, Austria. My dissertation on "Efficient numerical methods for open quantum many-body dynamics" was supervised by Prof. Hannes Pichler.

I am currently working at a ML/AI startup in Vienna, Austria. For my numerical simulations, I use Python/Cython and PyTorch.
